            <p>Hello! I'm Cat, a recent grad from the Front-End Web Development Program at BCIT.
                As a kid, my dream job was to be a video-game designer (though now i'd rather just play them) so I knew i wanted to do something in tech as a career. I also have past experience with some back-end languages like C++ and Java. In my free-time, I really like to game (which i like to think has helped my ability to work with a team).</p>
        </div>
